Simply run make to compile the source files. Example:

$ make

followed by:

$ ./insertsort <alpha>

e.g: 

$ ./badSort 2/3
or
$ ./badSort .6

to run the program

NOTE: I was unable to get the badSort program to sort the right half of any lists and ran out of time to write badSortTime due to unsuccessful troubleshooting efforts on this one. Sorry.
